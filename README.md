Marketing Campaign Analysis (Statistics with Excel Project)

Project Overview:

This project analyzes the performance of different marketing campaigns (Email, Social Media, Podcast, Webinar) using statistical methods in Excel.
The goal is to understand which campaign types perform better and whether factors like budget or channel influence success.

Steps & Analysis:

Data Cleaning:
Removed blanks/duplicates
Ensured numeric columns (Budget, Revenue) are correctly formatted

Descriptive Statistics:
Mean, Median, Standard Deviation of Budget & Revenue

Correlation Analysis:
Scatter Plot (Budget vs Revenue)
Correlation Coefficient → checked if higher budget drives higher revenue

T-Test (Comparing Campaign Types):
Example: Social Media vs Email Revenue
Found whether average revenue significantly differs between channels

Chi-Square Test (Categorical Relationship):
Success (0/1) vs Campaign Type
Tested if success rate depends on the type of campaign

Key Insights:

- Revenue & Budget are positively correlated → higher budget often drives higher revenue
- Campaign Type matters → some channels (e.g., Social Media) perform significantly better than others
- Success Rate is NOT evenly distributed → Chi-Square showed that campaign type influences success
- Business Takeaway → Focus more budget on high-performing channels for better ROI

Tools Used:

Excel → Data Cleaning, Descriptive Statistics, Correlation, T-Test, Chi-Square Test
Pivot Tables & Charts → For summary and visualization

Conclusion:

This project demonstrates how statistics in Excel can be applied to real-world marketing datasets to extract business insights.
